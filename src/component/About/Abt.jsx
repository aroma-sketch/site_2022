                        <p>Hi! My name is Aroma Gupta and currently, I am enrolled in Bachelor's Degree. I am a <span id="highlight">fourth-year student </span> studying <span id ="highlight">Information Technology</span>at<span  id="highlight"> D.Y Patil College Of Engineering,Pune</span>.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I have experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages to progressive web.<br /> I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>
                           <p>I love learning new and better ways to <span id="highlight">create seamless user experiences</span>  with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always <span id='highlight'> looking for opportunities</span> to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn.</p>
